# Home-Buyer-Fire
A program to predict a home's sell price using data scraped from the internet.

Home-Buyer-Fire was written in Python 3.7. For easy running/developing, I like using PyCharm.

If using PyCharm, ensure you add a Python Interpreter to your local Home-Buyer-Fire Project.

Requires use of beautifulsoup4, geopy, and requests packages.
